== Purpouse of the proxy ==

The programmable proxy implements a way to script web content
rewriting (aka. Content Adaptation) in web proxies. A content
adaptation script is a simple script that change the data passed to
it.

== System architecture ==

We use the Squid caching proxy and interface to it via ICAP. ICAP =
Internet Content Adaptation Protocol, a standard way to do this.
So Squid is the ICAP client and our programmable proxy is an ICAP server.

This terminology is slightly confusing since in HTTP and ICAP terms
our "programmable proxy" is not the proxy - it's the icap server
and squid is the http proxy. But it was named this way to be
less confusing for less technical audiences.

So the setup is: HTTP clients are confiqured to use Squid as the HTTP
proxy and Squid is configured to send responses through our
programmable proxy.

== Configuration ==

I used a demo setup with 2 machines, one running squid + proxy
and one doing net connection sharing and using netem to simulate
a slow net. The network graph (System Monitor app) was running
on the netem/connection sharing laptop.

The Squid configuration should have this:

--------- 8< -------------------
icap_enable on
icap_service chiru_mangler respmod_precache icap://127.0.0.1:11344/mangle

acl localhost src 127.0.0.1/32 ::1
acl from_uonet src 130.231.0.0/16
adaptation_access chiru_mangler allow localhost
adaptation_access chiru_mangler allow from_uonet
--------- 8< -------------------

The icap:// address points to the programmable proxy. In the above
example it's running on the same machine as squid so we point to the
loopback ip address. the adaptation_access limits who can access the
proxy. Note! It's important to restrict access, since otherwise
spammers will scan the net, find your proxy and do Bad Things - and it
will look like you are doing them!

Wireless setup with netem for the demo is done by connecting the
netem laptop to a fast-ish wlan (eg univ-guest), and connecting
the Airport base station to the laptop ethernet port. Then enable
connection sharing on that ethernet port ("shared to other computers"
in the connection editor). Now the traffic should work. To enable
netem, enable it with tc. For the demo video I used:

--------- 8< -------------------
tc qdisc del dev eth0 root # delete any pre-existing queuing discipline
tc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1: tbf rate 384 kbit buffer 1600 limit 3000
tc qdisc add dev eth0 parent 1: netem delay 50ms 20ms distribution normal
--------- 8< -------------------

For the demo case of showing the JPEG image loading and transcoding,
use 2 Android tablets both connected to the slowed down wlan.
The machine running the proxy is connected to the fast network.
For one of them, tell it to use a web proxy. This is in the
wlan settings, when you change parameters for a wlan it has an
"advanced" checkbox and that reveals the proxy settings.
So type in the addr for the Squid proxy at the faster network,
eg. 

 - implementation 

The proxy is written in the Go programming language. It's using
the go-icap library from https://code.google.com/p/go-icap/ (BSD license)

A couple of functions have been adapted from redwood-filter (BSD license),
which uses go-icap.

The code is simple & short, the handleIcap function handles
the ICAP "RESPMOD" request which sends in the response for
modification.  

The rewriting scripts are simply executables in path named according
to the rule "proxyfilter-<x>" where <x> is the real content-type with
/ replaced with _ etc. For example "proxyfilter-image_jpeg".

The scripts receive original content from standard input and write
transformed content to standard output. In addition they have access to
HTTP headers via environment variables, in the same way as CGI scripts
(ie. HTTP_ + header name in caps).

Building the proxy:

1. Check out ChiruAddons git repo and install go 1.0.x
2. set your GOPATH to point at the adaptation proxy dir: something like "export GOPATH=$HOME/src/ChiruAddons/adaptation-proxy"
3. Use the go get command to get the dependencies (in this case,
the chiru-icap library): type "go get"
4. build the binary: "go build -o chiru-caproxy"
5. running: just execute the binary, it'll listen on port 11344.
But you should have the content rewriting scripts in path. To
use the scripts in the repo, run it something like
"PATH=$PATH:$HOME/src/ChiruAddons/adaptation-proxy/proxybin ./chiru-caproxy"
If you're running squid on a different machine you can verify connectivity
by using telnet <hostname> 11344 (hostname being the machine running chiru-caproxy)
6. If your squid is set up, things should be working now. You'll get some
print output from chiru-caproxy when it's handling requests.

Ogre mesh rewriting:

There's an half-finished ogre mesh rewriting script in
ogrexml_parse_2.py that is based on the idea of using the
OgreXMLConverter utility from Ogre to do mesh simplification.  The
idea was to take the data from the automatic lod level-generation from
OgreXMLConverter and replace the main mesh vertex data with the
lod-reduced data. That utility however produced buggy results, and the
script wasn't completely finished. However Jonne tipped me off that
there latest Ogre 1.9 version has been rewritten and would be worth
checking out.
