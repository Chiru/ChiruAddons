                       Redland RDF Application Framework

[2]Dave Beckett

Overview

   [3]Redland is a library that provides a high-level interface for the
   Resource Description Framework (RDF) allowing the RDF graph to be
   parsed from XML, stored, queried and manipulated. Redland implements
   each of the RDF concepts in its own class via an object based API,
   reflected into the language APIs, currently C#, Java, Perl, PHP,
   Python, Ruby and Tcl. Several classes providing functionality such as
   for parsers, storage are built as modules that can be loaded at
   compile or run-time as required.

   This is a mature and stable RDF library developed since 2000 used in
   multiple projects. See the [4]todo list and the [5]FAQS for general
   information. A summary of the changes can be found in the [6]NEWS
   file, detailed API changes in the [7]release notes and file-by-file
   changes in the CVS [8]ChangeLog.

   Redland provides:
     * A modular, [9]object based library written in C
     * APIs for manipulating the RDF [10]graph and parts -
       [11]Statements, [12]Resources and Literals
     * Language Bindings in C#, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and Tcl via
       the [13]Redland Bindings package.
     * [14]Parsers and [15]Serializers for reading and writing RDF as
       [16]RDF/XML, [17]N-Triples and [18]Turtle Terse RDF Triple
       Language syntax via the [19]Raptor RDF Parser Toolkit.
     * [20]Storage for graphs in memory and on disk with
       Sleepycat/Berkeley DB, MySQL 3/4, [21]AKT Triplestore library,
       files or URIs.
     * [22]Query language support for RDQL using [23]Rasqal.
     * APIs for accessing the graph by Statement (triples) or by Nodes
       and Arcs
     * Redland contexts for managing aggregating graphs and recording
       provenance.
     * [24]Statement Streams for efficient construction, parsing and
       serialisation of graphs
     * [25]rdfproc RDF processor utility program
     * No memory leaks.
