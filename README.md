Chiru-Addons
============

Additional components for realXtend, developed in Chiru project

This project should be checked out into subdirectory "src" of 
main realxtend codebase. It should be possible to build the code
with realXtend upstream, but it is recommended to use Chiru
project fork from: 

 https://github.com/Chiru/naali

Modules and entity components are set in CMakeBuildConfigTemplate.txt.
If dependencies of the Chiru modules are in place (there is a lot of
them), the build should be straightforward. Use the following command
to checkout ChiruAddons into correct place (run from realXtend source
root:

 git clone git://github.com/Chiru/ChiruAddons.git src/ChiruAddons

Of use the SSH equivalent, if you prefer.
